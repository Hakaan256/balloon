- basket asset
- rope needs ~3+ states:
- - not cut, balloon on ground
- - not cut, balloon above ground, but not yet at tension (a dynamic transition between prev and next state)
- - not cut, balloon at tension (balloon above ground, being held down by ropes)
- - cut
- button ought not be "up" and "down", but instead "burn" and "open" (the purpose of this game is to demonstrate correlation btwn heating/cooling and vertical force- v important to not sidestep the "cause" because reasoning about "effect" is more intuitive.
- menu buttons for free play mode? (display/hide arrows, particles, etc...)
- people are really small, don't really hang out of basket
- little person has missing pole or something he's hugging?
- fire doesn't mesh with where the people are
