"Your distance: "+fdisp(balloon.wx,1)+" meters.",
"Good Work!",
"From now on, you can freely play around with whatever gauges you want!",
"Good Luck!",
]
[
"Ok- One Last Time. See how far you can get!",
"(This time, you can alter the volume mid-flight!)",
]
[
"See how <b>increasing the volume</b> brings <b>the force of gravity</b> <i>closer</i> to <b>the upward force of the surrounding particles</b>?",
"We'll still need to <b>heat the air in the balloon</b> just a bit-",
"But because we now have <b>more air to heat</b>, we <b>won't need to heat it as much!",
]
[
"So if a <b>balloon</b> is <b>lighter</b> than the <b>surounding air</b>, it begins to <b>float</b>.",
"But, a <b>marble</b> is lighter than even the <b>lightest</b> hot air balloon...",
"<i>Why doesn't <b>it</b> float?</i>",
"The reason is that, when we say \"<i>lighter than the surrounding air</i>\",",
"we really mean \"<i>lighter than the surrounding air <b>of the same size</b></i>\".",
"A <b>marble-sized</b> ball of air is <i>much</i> lighter than a marble...",
"so the marble \"<b>sinks</b>\" in the air!",
"Knowing this, we can -rather than alter the balloon's weight- <b>increase its volume</b> to generate lift!",
"Let's try that out!",
]
[
"This time, you were able to travel "+fdisp(balloon.wx,1)+" meters!",
"Notice that, while <b>floating at a constant height</b>, the <b>downward force</b> and the <b>upward force</b> on the balloon stayed about equal?",
"When this is the case, the object in suspension is said to be <b>neutrally bouyant</b>- it won't change its velocity up or down.",
"Let's reset again.",
]
[
"The <b>upward force on the balloon</b> created by the <b>downward force on the surrounding air particles</b> is now <b>greater</b> then the <b>downward force of gravity on the balloon</b>!",
"When the upward force is even <b>just a little bigger</b> than the downward force, it means the balloon will <b>start to rise</b>.",
"If we <b>keep this temperature in the balloon</b> (thus, maintaining its lighter-than-air weight), the balloon will <b>continue to rise, forever</b>.",
"Thankfully, <b>heat naturally escapes</b> from the balloon, letting <b>more air back in</b>, and <b>increasing the weight</b>.",
"You can accelerate this process by <b>opening the flap</b> near the top of the balloon. The temperature inside the balloon will <b>quickly decrease</b>, making the balloon <b>heavier</b>, and causing it to <b>sink</b>.",
"Again, try to get as far as you can!",
]
[
"But because the <b>balloon</b> is <b>heavier</b> than the <b>air particles trying to get under it</b>,",
"the baloon's gravity \"wins\" the struggle to <b>be pulled down</b>, and <b>stays on the ground</b>.",
"But what would happen if we were to <b>make the balloon lighter</b>?",
]
[
"Everything is being pulled down, but there is only so much space to be pulled down to!",
"All the little air particles are trying to wedge themselves <b>as low as they can</b>,",
"This creates a small <b>upward force</b> on the balloon.",
]
[
"But gravity doesn't just apply to <b>big</b> objects-",
"It also applies to all of those little air particles!",
]
[
"Ok. So <b>gravity</b> is the reason hot air balloons <b>float</b>?",
"How does that make sense?",
"Well, we know that <b>gravity</b> pulls <b>down</b> on <b>everything</b> (at least while on planet Earth, anyways...).",
"(That is, <b>gravity applies a downward force</b>.)",
]
[
"And you're back!",
"This time, you travelled "+fdisp(balloon.wx,1)+" meters.",
"But let's get back to that question:",
"<i>Why do <b>lighter</b> things <b>float</b></i>?",
"Maybe surprisingly, the answer is actually <b>gravity</b>.",
"Let's reset, and look at this again.",
]
[
"But wait, <i>why do <b>lighter</b> things <b>float</b></i>?",
"Ok ok. I'll let you get to flying.",
"Again, I'll be waiting for you on the ground!",
"See if you can get further than last time!",
"(Pro Tip- don't burn through all your fuel at once!)",
]
[
"See how the <b>air particles inside the balloon</b> are <b>moving faster</b>?",
"When air (or anything, really) gets <b>heated</b>, its molecules <b>jiggle very quickly</b>.",
"Molecules that are <b>bouncing all over the place</b> create <b>higher pressure within the balloon</b>.",
"This <b>higher pressure</b> pushes the air <b>out</b> of the balloon, making the balloon <b>much lighter than the surrounding air</b>.",
"And just like a <b>life vest</b> in <b>water</b>, the <b>balloon</b> begins to <b>float</b> in <b>air</b>!",
]
[
"We've <b>reset the temperature</b> inside the balloon (so it's equal to the temperature <b>outside</b> the balloon).",
"We're also <b>visualizing</b> the air particles <b>bouncing around</b> both <b>inside</b> <i>and</i> <b>outside</b> of the balloon.",
"See how <b>all the particles</b> are moving at just about <b>the same speed</b>?",
"Try to <b>get the balloon off the ground</b> again.",
"This time, <b>watch how the air particles are affected</b>.",
]
[
"Well that was fun. You travelled "+fdisp(balloon.wx,1)+" meters!",
"But how did it work?",
"Why does <b>heating the balloon</b> cause it to <b>rise</b>?",
"Let's reset everything, and try again",
]
[
"And off we go!",
"Ok enough talking... I'll let you fly around for now.",
"<b>To fly:</b><br />Press <b>burn</b> to <b>increase the temperature inside the balloon</b>,<br />open the <b>flap</b> to <b>release hot air</b>,<br />and be sure to <b>watch your fuel consumption</b>!",
"I'll be waiting on the ground!",
"(See how long you can fly!)",
]
[
"We've heated the ballon just enough to generate some <b>upward lift</b>!",
"<b>Cut the anchor rope</b> and let us go!</b>",
]
[
"Hey there!",
"This is a hot Air Balloon.",
"Let's see how this thing works!",
